If you are already here - thanks for visiting :)
This is my first own Python Project which I hope to develop and to learn a lot during this process.
My idea was to create a non-invasive reminder so you can always be up-to-date with your learning.
Of course there are milions of apps for mobile phones, but this one is mine and it's for desktops and laptops ;)
In future I would like it to have interface for users, settings and connection to database.
The future is bright! :)
